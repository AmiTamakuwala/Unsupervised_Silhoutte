I am sharing here about whole concept oif unsupervised learning which I learned from my revision task. 
small tips with some interview qusestions which help you to revise the concept wuth easy way.
not the whole concept able to explain here, but I am sure my notes which I shared will be use full.
* not only the Silhoutte topic is here but try to explain whole concept of unsupervised learning with graphs, which makes much more easy to explain.

--> Hichrarical Clustering
--> Validate Clustering: [Silhouette Clustering]
--> DBScan Clustering:
* Epsilon 
* Core Pts
* Border Pts
* Min Pts
